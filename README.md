# Zepto Theme
Open-sourced Shopify Store 2.0 theme with Tailwind CSS and Alpinejs. I've used Vite to ease the development process.

### How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install npm packages using `npm install`
3. Use `npm run dev` to start the server.
4. Use `npm run build` to build your JS and Tailwind css before finalizing your work.
5. Use `npm run prettier:format` to format your code.

### How to contribute
It will be updated later.
