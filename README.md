# Zepto Theme
Open-sourced Shopify Store 2.0 theme with Tailwind CSS and Alpinejs. I've used Vite to ease the development process.

### How to use
1. Clone the repository. Look at the `development` branch for latest code. `main` branch only be updated after testing new feature on developement first.
2. Install node packages using `npm install`
3. Use `npm run dev` to start the server. This is combined of 2 commands. One for to start vite server and another one is to start the shopify development server. You can check the `package.json` file for more details.
4. Use `npm run pull` to get the json file settings from your local shopify customizer (if you need). Which is an alias of `shopify theme pull`. 
5. Use `npm run prettier:format` to format your code. Use this command before the build one. Otherwise, this command will also format the minified css and js files.
6. Use `npm run build` to build your JS and Tailwind css before finalizing your work.
